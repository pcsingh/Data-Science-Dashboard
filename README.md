# Data-Science-Dashboard-using-Streamlit
In this project, I used an dataset of Tweets on US Airlines from Kaggle and perform a Sentiment analysis on it or try to showcase on WebApp using Streamlit framework. On the WebApp you can see the location of positive, negative and neutral tweets on US airlines by people in the world map. I used an Plotly for the Visualization and also build a Word Cloud of Tweets.
